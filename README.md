This file contains the implementation of the active-set method proposed in the following article


for the solution of convex quadratic programming problems with piecewise-linear terms in the objective.

The repository constists of the following files:

  1) An outer proximal method of multipliers (PMM),
  2) an inner semismooth Newton method (SSN),
  3) two ADMM-based warmstarting procedures,
  4) as well as three problem examples:
      i) from portfolio optimization
      ii) from quantile regression and 
      iii) from binary classification with linear SVMs.

Links to the datasets are provided.
